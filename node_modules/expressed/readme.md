# Expressed: A fluent wrapper around expressJs

Adds support to promises!

## Goal
- Don't be opinionated like `express-as-promised`. Errors call `next` instead
of returning a value. You can then handle the error however you want. For
example, you may want to sanitize the error before sending it over to the
client.
- Easy to understand and bypass. In some cases you may want to escape the 
wrapper. This library makes it easy to do.
- Don't swap methods on the express instance, this _could_ break functionality
in some way in the long term. Instead an object is created which hands over
arguments down to express.

## Considering...
- Should this support streams as well? hmm.
- Generator Support?
